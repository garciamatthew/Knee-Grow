        <h2>1. Leg Lifts</h2>
            <p>
                This exercise is designed to help strengthen the quadriceps. These are the large muscles on the front of the thigh. Leg lifts also help to strengthen the stomach muscles. This exercise allows you to strengthen your quads and abdominal muscles without placing a strain on the knee.
                
                How to do it
                
                Lie down on your back with our legs outstretched. Bend your right knee and keep your right foot planted to the ground. Keep your left leg straight and lift it up until it is level with your right knee. Keep your left foot bent to protect your knee. Hold the leg up for 5 seconds then lower it back on the floor and repeat. Do 10 to 15 repetitions on each leg.</p>
          <h2>2. Standing hamstring curls</h2>
          <p>This exercise helps to strengthen the hamstrings. These are the large muscles on the back of the thigh. This exercise also helps to strengthen the gluteal muscles. These are the muscles in the buttocks.

            How to do it
            
            Stand with both feet together. You may use a chair or wall for support. Bend your right knee and lift your right foot while keeping your left foot planted on the floor. Bend your knee until it is at a 90 degree angle. Do not flex the foot. Keep the foot neutral all through. Hold for 5 seconds and lower the foot to the floor. Repeat for 10 to 15 repetitions on each leg.</p>
          <h2>3. Step-ups</h2>
            <p>This exercise helps to strengthen the quadriceps, hip flexors, glutes and hamstrings overall leading to  strengthening knee in the process.

                How to do it
                
                It should be performed on a raised surface such as a step bench, the lowest step in a staircase or a platform. Stand in front of the step with your feet together. Keep your pelvis level and bend your knee to slowly raise it and set your foot flat on the platform. Shift your body weight to the leg on the platform and lift your body until you’re standing up straight. Repeat this 10 to 15 times. Do the same for the other leg.</p>
        <h2>4. Wall squats</h2>
        <p>This exercise works the glutes and the quads. Doing squats against the wall takes some of the pressure off your knees.

            How to do it
            
            Stand with your back against a wall. Press your shoulders, back and hips against the wall. Step both of your feet a few inches from the wall and bring your hips down while keeping your back pressed against the wall. Keep your feet shoulder width apart and lower your hips until they are level with your knees in a sitting position. Hold for 5 seconds and then slide back up. Repeat this for 10 to 15 repetitions.</p>
        <h2>5. Calf raises</h2>
        <p>This exercise is designed to strengthen the calves. It also helps to strengthen the ankles and the shins providing even greater support to the knees.

            How to do it
            
            The exercise can be done on a flat surface or on a raised surface. If you are performing the exercise on a flat surface, stand with your feet together. Raise your heels as high as you can and then lower them to the ground. If you’re using a raised platform, stand with your heels hanging off the edge of the platform. Raise your heels up and lower them. Repeat this 10 to 15 times.
            
            Use these gentle exercises to strengthen your knee. If you experience pain, contact Dr. Chris Boone to determine the cause of the pain and find a solution.</p>
